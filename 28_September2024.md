# Minimal Cost

To solve the problem of minimizing the cost to traverse an array where the cost of moving from one position to another is based on the absolute difference between the array elements, we can use a **Dynamic Programming (DP)** approach.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We are given an array `arr[]` and a maximum jump distance `k`. We start at index `0` and need to reach the end of the array. The cost to jump from index `i` to index `j` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`.
- We need to determine the minimum possible cost to reach the end of the array, but we can only jump up to `k` steps at a time.

### Key Concept:
- **Dynamic Programming**: We'll define a DP array `dp[]` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach index `i` from the start of the array. We'll update this array by considering the possible jumps from each preceding index within the range of `k`.

### Approach:
1. **DP Initialization**: 
   - Initialize `dp[0] = 0` since there's no cost to start at the first position.
   - For all other positions, initialize `dp[i]` with a large value (infinity) since we aim to minimize the cost.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - For each index `i`, we calculate the cost to jump from any previous index `j` (where `i - k <= j < i`) to the current index `i`. The cost is calculated as `|arr[i] - arr[j]|`, and we update `dp[i]` with the minimum value.

3. **Result**:
   - After processing all the indices, the value of `dp[n-1]` (where `n` is the length of the array) will give the minimal cost to reach the last position.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times k)\), where `n` is the number of elements in the array and `k` is the maximum jump length. For each element, we check up to `k` previous elements, making the approach efficient enough for typical input sizes.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for the `dp` array to store the minimum cost at each position.

### Java Code Implementation:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimizeCost(int k, int arr[]) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        
        // Initialize dp array with maximum possible values
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }

        // Base case: starting at the first position has no cost
        dp[0] = 0;

        // Fill the dp array
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            // Look back at the previous k steps and calculate the minimum cost
            for (int j = Math.max(0, i - k); j < i; j++) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j] + Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[j]));
            }
        }

        // The minimum cost to reach the last element is stored in dp[n-1]
        return dp[n - 1];
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **DP Array Initialization**:
   - We initialize a `dp` array where `dp[0] = 0` (since there's no cost to start at the first element) and all other values are initialized to a large number (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`).
   
2. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - For each index `i`, we check all possible jumps from the previous `k` indices (i.e., from `i-k` to `i-1`), and we calculate the cost as `dp[j] + |arr[i] - arr[j]|`. The minimum cost for each index is stored in `dp[i]`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The minimum cost to reach the last index is stored in `dp[n-1]`, and this value is returned as the result.

### Example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        int[] arr1 = {10, 30, 40, 50, 20};
        int k1 = 3;
        System.out.println(solution.minimizeCost(k1, arr1));  // Expected Output: 30

        int[] arr2 = {10, 20, 10};
        int k2 = 1;
        System.out.println(solution.minimizeCost(k2, arr2));  // Expected Output: 10
    }
}
```

### Walkthrough of Example:
For `arr1 = {10, 30, 40, 50, 20}` and `k = 3`:
- The possible transitions are:
  - From `arr[0]` to `arr[1]` (cost = `|30 - 10| = 20`),
  - From `arr[0]` to `arr[2]` (cost = `|40 - 10| = 30`),
  - From `arr[1]` to `arr[2]` (cost = `|40 - 30| = 10`), and so on.
  
The DP array will be filled as:
- `dp[0] = 0`
- `dp[1] = 20`
- `dp[2] = 30`
- `dp[3] = 40`
- `dp[4] = 30`

The result is `30`, which is the minimum cost to reach the last element.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Single Element Array**: If `arr` has only one element, the cost is `0` since no movement is needed.
2. **Large `k` Value**: If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, it means we can jump directly to the last element. The solution handles this by considering all possible jumps up to `k`.

### Best Practices:
- **Efficiency**: The solution is optimized by considering only up to `k` previous steps for each index, making it scalable for larger input sizes.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Properly handles small arrays and large jump values.
- **Clarity**: The code is structured and easy to follow, with clear logic for each step.

## Conclusion:
The dynamic programming solution provides an efficient way to minimize the cost of reaching the last position in the array while adhering to the jump constraints. It ensures optimal performance and handles various edge cases effectively.
