The given problem is **Next Greater Element (NGE)**, with a twist that **next greater may appear later even in circular manner** (second example).

---

### ✅ Problem Summary:

Given an array `arr[]`, for every element `arr[i]`, find the **next greater element**:

* Normally, it’s the next element `> arr[i]` to its right.
* But in **some examples**, the array is **circular**, i.e., after the last element, we wrap around to the beginning.

---

### ✅ Clarifying the Problem:

You showed both:

* Linear NGE: `[1, 3, 2, 4] → [3, 4, 4, -1]`
* Circular NGE: `[0, 2, 3, 1, 1] → [2, 3, -1, 2, 2]`

Thus, we’ll solve the **Circular NGE** version (generalized). Works for both.

### ✅ Optimal Strategy (Monotonic Stack + Circular Loop)

* Traverse the array **twice in reverse** (`2n → 0`) to simulate circular behavior.
* Use a **monotonic decreasing stack** to keep candidates for next greater.
* At each step:

  * Pop smaller or equal elements.
  * The top of the stack is next greater.

### ✅ Time & Space Complexity:

* **Time:** `O(N)`
* **Space:** `O(N)` for stack and result

---

### ✅ Final Java Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> nextLargerElement(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(Collections.nCopies(n, -1));
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (int i = 2 * n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int idx = i % n;
            int curr = arr[idx];

            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() <= curr) {
                stack.pop();
            }

            if (i < n) {
                if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                    result.set(idx, stack.peek());
                }
            }

            stack.push(curr);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### 🔍 Example Trace:

For `arr = [0, 2, 3, 1, 1]`:

* We iterate from `2n - 1 → 0`, ensuring circular behavior.
* Monotonic stack always has next greater candidate at top.
