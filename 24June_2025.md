To solve the problem **"Lexicographically Largest String After Deleting K Characters"**, we aim to delete `k` characters from string `s` such that the **resulting string is lexicographically largest** and the **order of characters is preserved**.

---

### ✅ **Optimal Approach: Monotonic Stack (Greedy)**

We maintain a **stack-like structure** to **greedily keep the best characters** and drop smaller ones if possible.

---

### ✅ **Key Observations**

* We want the remaining string to be of length `n - k`.
* While traversing `s`, remove from the stack if:

  * Stack is non-empty
  * Current char > top of stack
  * We still have deletions left

---

### ✅ **Time & Space Complexity**

* **Time:** `O(n)` — single pass
* **Space:** `O(n - k)` — for result

---

### ✅ **Final Java Code**

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public static String maxSubseq(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        int keep = n - k;
        Deque<Character> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && k > 0 && stack.peekLast() < c) {
                stack.pollLast();
                k--;
            }
            stack.addLast(c);
        }

        // Build result with only the first (n - k) characters
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : stack) {
            if (count == keep) break;
            result.append(c);
            count++;
        }

        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

### 🔍 Example

Input: `s = "abcde", k = 2`
Keep length = `3`, result = `"cde"` — since removing `'a'` and `'b'` gives the largest possible lexicographic result.
