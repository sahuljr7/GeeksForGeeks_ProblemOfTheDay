To solve the **"Game with String"** problem optimally, we aim to **minimize the value of the string** after performing `k` deletions. Each deletion removes one occurrence of any character. The value of the string is calculated as:

> **Sum of squares of frequency of all remaining characters**.

### âœ… **Optimal Approach: Max Heap (PriorityQueue)**

Use a **max-heap** to always reduce the character with the highest frequency â€” this greedily minimizes the resulting string value.

---

### âœ… **Steps:**

1. Count frequency of each character.
2. Insert frequencies into a max-heap.
3. Perform `k` deletions by reducing the top frequency.
4. After all deletions, compute the sum of squares of remaining frequencies.

### âœ… **Time & Space Complexity**

* **Time:** `O(N + 26 log 26 + K log 26)` â†’ effectively `O(N + K)` (heap size â‰¤ 26)
* **Space:** `O(26)` â†’ fixed for English lowercase characters

### âœ… **Java Code**

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minValue(String s, int k) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }

        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());

        for (int f : freq) {
            if (f > 0) maxHeap.offer(f);
        }

        while (k-- > 0 && !maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int top = maxHeap.poll();
            if (top > 1) {
                maxHeap.offer(top - 1);
            }
        }

        int sum = 0;
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int f = maxHeap.poll();
            sum += f * f;
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§  Greedy Justification:

Reducing the highest frequency gives the maximum reduction in square value, e.g., reducing 5Â² â†’ 4Â² = 25 â†’ 16 = Î”9, better than reducing smaller freq.
