# Rotate and delete

### Algorithm to Solve the Problem:
1. **Input and Initialization**:
   - We start by reading the input list `arr`.
   - The length of the list is stored in `z`.
   - Calculate half the length of the list, `val = z/2`, to determine how many iterations will be needed.

2. **Rotate and Delete Process**:
   - We begin with an index `i = 0`, which tracks how far we are in the process of deleting elements.
   - In each iteration, we perform two operations:
     1. **Rotate the Array**: Remove the last element from the list and insert it at the front.
     2. **Delete an Element**: After the rotation, delete the `i-th` element from the end of the list.
   - After each iteration, we decrease `val` (number of iterations remaining) and increment `i` (to progressively delete elements further from the end).

3. **Termination**:
   - The process continues until `val` becomes 0, meaning we have completed the required number of iterations.
   - The remaining element in the list is returned as the result.

### Optimized and Commented Code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class Solution {

    /**
     * This function takes an ArrayList of integers, repeatedly rotates it by moving the
     * last element to the front, and deletes the i-th element from the end in each step.
     * The process continues until only one element remains.
     *
     * @param arr The input ArrayList of integers.
     * @return The last remaining element after all the rotations and deletions.
     */
    public static int rotateDelete(ArrayList<Integer> arr) {
        // Step 1: Initialize the length of the array
        int z = arr.size();  // 'z' holds the initial size of the list.

        // Step 2: Calculate how many times we need to perform the rotate and delete operation.
        // Since we remove an element in each iteration, we perform this operation 'z/2' times.
        int val = z / 2;

        // Step 3: Initialize the index counter 'i' to keep track of which element we are deleting from the end.
        int i = 0;

        // Step 4: Loop until we have performed 'val' number of rotations and deletions.
        while (val > 0) {
            // Get the current size of the array
            int n = arr.size();  // Get the current size of the list.

            // Step 5: Rotate the list - take the last element and move it to the front.
            int a = arr.get(n - 1);  // Get the last element of the list.
            arr.remove(n - 1);       // Remove the last element from the list.
            arr.add(0, a);           // Add the removed element to the front of the list.

            // Step 6: Delete the 'i-th' element from the end of the list after rotation.
            arr.remove(n - 1 - i);   // Remove the element at the calculated position.

            // Step 7: Decrease the number of iterations left.
            val--;  // Decrease the iteration count (remaining deletions).

            // Step 8: Increment 'i' to progressively delete elements further from the end.
            i++;  // Increment 'i' for the next deletion position.
        }

        // Step 9: After all rotations and deletions, return the first element of the list.
        return arr.get(0);  // The remaining element in the list is the answer.
    }
}
```

### Step-by-Step Algorithm:

1. **Input Initialization**:
   - Start with the given array `arr` of size `z = arr.size()`.
   - Compute `val = z / 2` to represent how many times we need to perform the rotate and delete operation.

2. **Loop Setup**:
   - Initialize `i = 0` as a counter for tracking which element to delete from the end.

3. **Main Loop** (repeat until `val` becomes zero):
   - **Step 1**: Get the last element `a = arr.get(arr.size() - 1)` and remove it from the array.
   - **Step 2**: Insert this last element at the beginning using `arr.add(0, a)`.
   - **Step 3**: After rotation, delete the element at the `n - 1 - i` position where `n` is the current size of the array.
   - **Step 4**: Decrease `val` by 1 to reflect that we completed one iteration.
   - **Step 5**: Increase `i` by 1 to ensure we are deleting progressively further elements from the end.

4. **Return the Remaining Element**:
   - Once `val` becomes zero, only one element remains in the list. Return that element as the result.

### Example Walkthrough:

For input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`:

1. Initial array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, `val = 3`, `i = 0`.
2. **Iteration 1**:
   - Rotate: `[6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Delete: Remove the last element (5), result: `[6, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
3. **Iteration 2**:
   - Rotate: `[4, 6, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Delete: Remove the second last element (3), result: `[4, 6, 1, 2]`
4. **Iteration 3**:
   - Rotate: `[2, 4, 6, 1]`
   - Delete: Remove the third last element (4), result: `[2, 6, 1]`
5. **Final Output**:
   - After all rotations and deletions, the remaining element is `3`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\) where `n` is the initial size of the array. Although the array size shrinks, each rotation and deletion is done in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) additional space is used apart from the input array.

This updated solution follows the original problem logic while ensuring clarity and maintaining efficiency.
