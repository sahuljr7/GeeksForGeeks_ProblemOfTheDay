The **most optimized Java solution** for the GFG problem:
[**Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/kth-smallest-number-in-multiplication-table/1)

---

### ✅ Problem Summary:

You’re given a `m x n` multiplication table. Find the **k-th smallest** number in it.

---

### ✅ Optimal Approach: Binary Search

Rather than generating the table (too large for m, n up to 3e4), use **binary search** on value range.

#### Key Insight:

For a number `mid`, count how many numbers ≤ `mid` exist in the table:

```java
count(mid) = ∑ (mid / i) for i = 1 to m, bounded by n
```

---

### ✅ Java Code (Binary Search):

```java
class Solution {
    public int kthSmallest(int m, int n, int k) {
        int low = 1, high = m * n;
        int ans = 0;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int count = countLessEqual(mid, m, n);

            if (count >= k) {
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

    // Count how many values ≤ val exist in the m x n multiplication table
    private int countLessEqual(int val, int m, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            count += Math.min(n, val / i);
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### ✅ Time and Space Complexity:

| Metric           | Complexity        |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Time Complexity  | `O(m * log(m*n))` |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)`            |

---

### ✅ Example:

Input:

```
m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
```

Multiplication Table:

```
1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9
```

**5th smallest = 3** ✅
