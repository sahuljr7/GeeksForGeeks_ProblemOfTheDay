### ✅ **Optimized Strategy: Sliding Min-2 Using Monotonic Stack**

Observation:

> For every subarray of size ≥ 2, we need the **two smallest elements**.
> But going through **all O(N²)** subarrays won't scale.

---

### ✅ **New Insight**

We can efficiently compute for **each pair of adjacent elements**, and **extend the subarray** while keeping track of the two smallest elements using **monotonic queues** — still too slow.

Instead, since the maximum is over:

> “sum of the two smallest in any subarray of size ≥ 2”

We can **reduce the problem** to:

> For each **pair (i, j)** where `j > i`, check if `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` are the two smallest in **any valid subarray**.

This leads to the fastest idea:

---

### ✅ **Linear Time Approach**

Loop once, and at each position `i`, **compare it with its previous** to get local 2-min and update the max.

So we reduce the search space to **only adjacent pairs**, which are the minimum required subarrays (size 2).

But to handle the **maximum sum of two mins**, we need to try **all such possible contiguous increasing/decreasing subarrays**.

Instead, we settle for:

> Sliding window of fixed size `w = 2` — find sum of 2-min

We slide a window of size 2 across the array and record the **sum of the two elements**, which is what the 2-min sum would be.

### ✅ Final Optimized Java Code (O(N))

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSum(int[] arr) {
        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int n = arr.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int a = arr[i];
            int b = arr[i + 1];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, a + b);
        }

        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

### ⚠️ Why This Works

Because:

* Any larger subarray will contain elements ≥ min1 and min2 of some **length-2 subarray**.
* So, **maximum of all 2-element sums** will always be one of the candidates.

### ✅ Time & Space

* **Time:** `O(N)`
* **Space:** `O(1)`
